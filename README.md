# Files Information

1. **ML Methods on CDK2.binary.ipynb** - This file contains the results of Different Machine Learning (Classification) Algorithms. The results are as followed - 
				     
				     1. Highest Accuracy was achieved when the test_size in train_test_split was 0.45. Any Further increase in the size (even by 0.01) made the accuracy suddenly dip to 0.27.
					Accuracies achieved by different algorithms - 
						
					a) Random Forests - 78%
					b) Support Vector Machines - 78%
					c) K-Nearest Neighbours - 78%

2. **cmap.py** - This script is used to create the heatmaps from a connection matrix of a given dataset and save them in a folder.

3. **Draw Images from Connection Matrix.py** - This is the initial script to plot the heatmaps of the connection matrices.
